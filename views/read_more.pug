            While standard systems for digital control have gravitated towards 
            levels of complexity that require more and more specialised expertise, 
            a revolution has been taking place. The capability of the Internet of 
            Things has moved from theory to reality.
          p.lead.
            This potential has been ignored by the controls community. Until now.

            Business models that depend on constant vendor interaction lead to systems 
            of poor quality. QooNet is 100% open source. The code is yours 
            to modify and optimise to your needs, and is accessible enough to 
            make this a reality.

          p.lead.
            With mobile control an expectation of modern systems, real-time connections 
            are vital to maintaining the quality of the data for all users. While 
            such communciations could overburden traditional control systems, the QooNet 
            architecture is immune from this.
