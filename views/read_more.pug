            While standard systems for digital control have gravitated towards 
            levels of complexity that require more and more specialised expertise, 
            a revolution has been taking place. The capability of the Internet of 
            Things has moved from potential to reality.

            This potential has been ignored by the controls community. Until now.

            Business models that depend on contant vendor interaction lead to 
            poor quality systems. Qoonet is 100% open source. The code is yours 
            to modify and optimise to your needs, and is accessible enough to 
            make this a reality.
